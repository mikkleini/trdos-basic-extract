# trdos-extract
TR-DOS filesystem extract and BASIC detokenizer

These two SW applications can be used to restore old Basic codes from 5.25" flopyy disks which were used with Sinclari Spectrum ZX clones (Pentagon 48).
First have to get flopyy drive and Greazeweasle board to get flux data, then decode it with HxCFloppyEmulator into raw images.
Then use TR-DOS extractor and finally the Basic detokenizer.
